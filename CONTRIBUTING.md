# Contributing to React-UI
We are open project and welcome contributions of all kinds: from discussion to documentation to bugfixes to feature improvements.

Please review this document to help to streamline the process and save everyone's precious time.

## Issues

No software is bug-free. So, if you got an issue, follow these steps:

-   Search the [issue list](https://github.com/moove-it/react-ui/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) for current and old issues.
    -   If you find an existing issue, please UPVOTE the issue by adding a "thumbs-up reaction". We use this to help prioritize issues!
-   If none of that is helping, create an issue with the following information:
    -   Clear title (shorter is better).
    -   Describe the issue in clear language.
    -   Share error logs, screenshots and etc.
    -   To speed up the issue fixing process, send us a sample repo with the issue you faced:

### Closing issues

To keep the project's backlog clean, the following rules will be aplied to issues:

-   Duplicate issues should be closed with a link to the original.
-   Unreproducible issues should be closed if it's not possible to reproduce them (if the reporter drops offline,
    it is reasonable to wait 2 weeks before closing).
-   `bug`s should be labelled `merged` when merged, and be closed when the issue is fixed and released.
-   `feature`s, `maintenance`s, `greenkeeper`s should be labelled `merged` when merged,
    and closed when released or if the feature is deemed not appropriate.
-   `question / support`s should be closed when the question has been answered.
    If the questioner drops offline, a reasonable period to wait is two weeks.
-   `discussion`s should be closed at a maintainer's discretion.
